Hello {{info.name}},

ZuriHac is happening in exactly a month, and we hope you are as excited
as we are! This email serves as a reminder and contains some practical
info, so please read all the way through.

Please confirm (or cancel) your registration here:
https://zureg.zfoh.ch/ticket?uuid={{uuid}}

This helps us know how many people are attending, which we need
to plan ahead for things like food and rooms. Confirming your
registration will give you access to your ticket, that you need to
show at the registration desk.

You can find the schedule and many details at https://zurihac.info. We
will keep on updating this and the website remains the "single source
of truth".

Simon Peyton Jones, Gabriella Gonzalez, Alexis King, Ben Lynn and
Conal Elliott will be giving talks.

There will be a track about Category Theory by Bartosz Milewski and an
Advanced Track by Well-Typed. A track for complete beginners will also
be available!

Don't forget to bring a power adaptor for Swiss electrical
sockets.  A lot of European plugs might not fit:

On your registration page, you will find a Discord invite. We will
use this chat platform to communicate important information and
announcements during the event, but it's also extremely useful to
socialize with fellow participants.

It's a long-standing tradition to have a drink next to the lake
the day before the hackathon with Haskellers who are already in
town. We'll have two: one in Zurich and one in Rapperswil. Join
#friday-zurich and #friday-rapperswil on Discord for details.

We've posted a list of projects that people are planning on working on
here: https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2023/projects/ -- feel free to add your
own, instructions are on that page!

ZuriHac is a non-commercial event put together entirely by volunteers
in their free time! We may need some extra hands this year for
relatively light non-technical work (moving benches, tables and
chairs...). Please keep an eye on the #volunteers channel if you would
be willing to donate just a bit of your time to making this event
possible :-)

Organising ZuriHac would not be possible without the support of our
awesome sponsors. Huge thanks for their help! We are still very
much looking for additional sponsors this year, to ensure ZuriHac
can continue happening in the future. Please contact us for more
information if you're interested.
