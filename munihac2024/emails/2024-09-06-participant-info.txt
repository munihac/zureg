Hello {{info.name}},

MuniHac 2024 is only five weeks away, and we're excited to have you all in Munich
again!

Here's a few updates from our side as well as some organizational stuff:

# IMPORTANT: Please confirm (or cancel) your registration here:

    https://registration.munihac.de/ticket?uuid={{uuid}}

    By confirming your registration, we have a better overview over how many
    people will actually be attending, which helps us plan ahead for things like
    food and rooms. Confirming your registration will give you access to your
    ticket.
    In case you won't be able to attend, we ask you to cancel your registration.

# Venue and Hotels

    MuniHac 2024 will take place at the TNG Technoloy Consulting offices,
    Beta-Straße 13a, Unterföhring. The venue can be reached S-Bahn and Bus.

    In case you're still looking for accomodation, we've added a list of nearby
    hotels to our website: https://munihac.de/2024.html#hotels

# Keynotes, talks and workshops

    While the main focus of MuniHac is in getting together and hacking on
    projects, we also want to provide a line-up of talks and workshops:

    * Three keynotes by Hécate, Niki Vazou, and Hannes Siebenhandl
    * As always, there will be a Beginners Workshop that teaches the basics of
      Haskell
    * And more talks and workshops!
    
    The full list can be found on https://munihac.de/2024.html#programme, we'll
    update the page regularly. We'll also release the schedule soon.

# Communication

    As in the last years, you can use our Slack space for communicating with
    other attendees. If you haven't done yet, please subscribe to the
    #munihac-2024 channel for announcements! If you don't have an account yet,
    you can create one via this invite link:

We're looking forward to seeing you in Munich!
