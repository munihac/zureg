Hello {{info.name}},

MuniHac 2020 is taking place tomorrow!

Here's what we've prepared:

# How to join

The entire programme for each day can be found on

    https://join.munihac.de

From there, you can directly join the corresponding Zoom sessions, join the
Slack channels for questions and discussion, or simply watch the Youtube live
stream.

We have been quite liberal with time in between talks, and there are break rooms
available to establish a virtual hallway track. You can join a random break
room, or look for people you want to connect with.

In addition, we have dedicated Zoom sessions for hacking on projects. If you
want to host a project, let us know in the #support channel on Slack! Then we
can open a session for you and list it on the programme.

# Tools and how to use them

More than 250 Haskellers have registered for MuniHac! We're glad so many of you
are going to join us, however for things to go smoothly, there are a few
guidelines:

## Zoom

* To participate in a talk or workshop, just join the corresponding Zoom
  session.
* For projects, use Zoom for mob or pair programming. Just join the session and
  have a look around. If no-one happens to be in the session (maybe they're just
  visiting a talk or workshop?), just let them know in the project Slack channel
  that you're interested in joining.
* For the breaks and the evening get-together, additional Zoom sessions are
  available. If you just want to meet new people, you can just join a random
  session.

## Slack

Our main medium for textual communication will be Slack, so make sure you're
signed up:

    https://join.slack.com/t/munihac/shared_invite/zt-gaq3veyb-u3j9F0LqN0Q60Zc2MVqvSw

* Use Slack to get in touch with other participants.
* For talks and workshops, asking questions on the dedicated Slack channels is
  encouraged. We have Track Managers watching these channels, so your Questions
  won't get lost. (That is, of course, unless the speaker says otherwise.)
* For projects, Slack is also the default way to get in touch.

The #munihac-2020 channel will be used for announcements, so make sure to join!
For getting in touch with the organisers, we have the #support channel which we
will monitor.

## Youtube

* Most talks and workshops are also streamed on Youtube. If you just want to
  listen, that's perfectly fine.
* You can still use Slack to ask questions!

Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!
