Hello {{info.name}},

If you are planning to join one of the workshops at MuniHac 2020, you can
already connect with speakers and other participants. We've created Slack
channels for all workshops, so join the ones you're interested in and learn
about prerequisites and preparation!

If you haven't yet, join us on Slack:

    https://join.slack.com/t/munihac/shared_invite/zt-gaq3veyb-u3j9F0LqN0Q60Zc2MVqvSw

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us in the #support channel!
