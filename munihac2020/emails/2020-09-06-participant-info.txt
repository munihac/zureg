Hello {{info.name}},

MuniHac is coming up soon!

With just one week to go, we'd like to give you some updates about how MuniHac
is going to be organized this year.

# Programme

The preliminary programme for MuniHac 2020 is now online. Friday, September 11
at 11:30 CEST, we will start off two days packed with talks, workshops and
Haskell hacking.

The programme can be found on the MuniHac website,

    https://munihac.de/2020.html

Please note that all times are CEST (UTC +2).

# Communication Channels

* Zoom: All talks and workshops will be held via zoom.us, so installing a
  client or making otherwise sure that you can join Zoom calls is a good idea.
* Youtube: Additionally, all talks will be streamed on Youtube.
* Slack: We're going to use Slack for questions and discussion on the individual
  talks and workshops, as well as for connecting with other MuniHac
  participants.

There'll be an overview over all Zoom conferences, Youtube streams and Slack
channels on the day of the conference.

If you haven't yet, register for Slack at

    https://join.slack.com/t/munihac/shared_invite/zt-gaq3veyb-u3j9F0LqN0Q60Zc2MVqvSw

and join the #munihac-2020 channel, where you can meet up with other guests.

# Projects

Although the focus this year is more on workshops and talks, MuniHac would not
be a proper Haskell hackathon without some hacking sessions. We've reserved a
few Zoom rooms for you to get together and hack on projects, so if you want to
host a project at MuniHac 2020, just get in touch with us at
munihac@tngtech.com! We'll create a Zoom session and slack channel for you, and
publish them so people can join you for your project.

# More Info

More detailed information on the programme and speakers is on the MuniHac
website:

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via email
(munihac@tngtech.com), or on Slack!

Looking forward to seeing you online at MuniHac 2020!
