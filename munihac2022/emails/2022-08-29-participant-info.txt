Hello {{info.name}},

MuniHac 2022 is only six weeks away, and we're excited to have you all in Munich
again for an in-person event!

Here's a few updates from our side as well as some organizational stuff:

# IMPORTANT: Please confirm (or cancel) your registration here:

    https://registration.munihac.de/ticket?uuid={{uuid}}

    By confirming your registration, we have a better overview over how many
    people will actually be attending, which helps us plan ahead for things like
    food and rooms. Confirming your registration will give you access to your
    ticket.
    In case you won't be able to attend, we ask you to cancel your registration.

# Venue and Hotels

    MuniHac 2022 will take place at the TNG Technoloy Consulting offices,
    Arabellastraße 4, Munich. (This is a new venue compared to 2019 and before!)

    The venue can be reached easily via Metro (U4 Arabellapark) as well as Bus
    and Tram (Effnerplatz).

# Keynotes, talks and workshops

    projects, we also want to provide a line-up of talks and workshops:

    * Three keynotes by Gabriella Gonzalez, Ben Gamari and Nicolas Wu
    * As always, there will be a Beginners Workshop that teaches the basics of
      Haskell
    * And more talks and workshops – more info will follow soon!
