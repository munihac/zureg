Hello {{info.name}},

three weeks to go for MuniHac 2022! Here's some more updates and organizational
stuff:

# IMPORTANT: Please confirm (or cancel) your registration here:

    https://registration.munihac.de/ticket?uuid={{uuid}}

    By confirming your registration, we have a better overview over how many
    people will actually be attending, which helps us plan ahead for things like
    food and rooms. Confirming your registration will give you access to your
    ticket.
    In case you won't be able to attend, we ask you to cancel your registration.

# Programme and schedule

    https://munihac.de/2022.html#schedule

    While the main focus of MuniHac is in getting together and hacking on
    projects, we are also happy to provide a line-up of three keynotes, five
    talks, and four workshops!

    You can find the preliminary schedule on the MuniHac website. There might be
    some updates in the next weeks, so be sure to check again before the event!

# Venue

    MuniHac 2022 will take place at the TNG Technoloy Consulting offices,
    Arabellastraße 4, Munich. (This is a new venue compared to 2019 and before!)

    The venue can be reached easily via Metro (U4 Arabellapark) as well as Bus
    and Tram (Effnerplatz).

# Communication

    As in the last years, you can use our Slack space for communicating with
    other attendees. If you haven't done yet, please subscribe to the
