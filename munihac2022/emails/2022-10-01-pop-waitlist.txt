Hello {{info.name}},

Due to some cancellations, we were able to free up a spot for you at MuniHac!
With one week to go, we know it's a bit short term. But if it works for you
with travel and accomodation, we'd be glad to see you in Munich!

We ask you to give us a heads up if you're coming or not as soon as possible.
You can do this by either confirming or cancelling your registration here:

    https://registration.munihac.de/ticket?uuid={{uuid}}

This helps us plan ahead for the event, and if you can't join us, free up a
spot for someone else on the waiting list.

Thanks for your help!

Here's some more information:

# Venue

    MuniHac 2022 will take place at the TNG Technoloy Consulting offices,
    Arabellastraße 4, Munich. (This is a new venue compared to 2019 and before!)

    The venue can be reached easily via Metro (U4 Arabellapark) as well as Bus
    and Tram (Effnerplatz).

# Programme and schedule

    While the main focus of MuniHac is in getting together and hacking on
    projects, we are also happy to provide a line-up of three keynotes, five
    talks, and four workshops!

    You can find the preliminary schedule on the MuniHac website. There might be
    some updates in the next weeks, so be sure to check again before the event!
